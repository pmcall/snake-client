# Snake: *The Slow Version*

## A *slow* slither down memory lane
Do you remember the game that came with every old phone? Snake is clearly a cultural touchpoint for many generations, but was also stress-inducing with all that speed!

Welcome to the snow lane: *Snake The Slow Version* is a retake on a cultural classic. All the fun, without that pesky speed. 
## Same rules, new speed 
Look for the food, avoid the walls, take it easy! The concept is the same: maneuvers the snake head-first and let is grow by ‘eating’ pieces of food. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it ~~dies~~ takes a nap.

## You get a snake, you get a snake!
Did I mention this is multiplayer?!
